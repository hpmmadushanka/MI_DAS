step 1 - Clone this repository (Our main repository)
step 2 - clone https://github.com/dbolya/yolact.git to an another folder ( Because we need the YOLACT segmentation to our project)

Copy the below folders and files from the second repository to our repository.
1. Layers
2. Utils
3. backbone.py
4. run_coco_eval.py
5. train.py
6. yolact.py


Then in the main directory you need to create a folder named "weights" and you should download the weights from the internet to this "weights" folder. 
The following links for the weights downloads have been given below.
